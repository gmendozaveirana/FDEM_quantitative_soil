def arrays_are_similar(a, b):
    """
    Calculates if two numpy arrays are similar.
    
    This function determines whether two numpy arrays, a and b, are similar based on two criteria:

    The arrays must have the same shape.
    The elements in corresponding positions must either both be NaN (Not a Number) or be numerically close to each other, within the tolerance defined by numpy.isclose.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a (numpy.ndarray): The first array to compare.
    b (numpy.ndarray): The second array to compare.

    Returns
    -------
    bool: 
        Returns True if the arrays are considered similar, otherwise False.

    Example
    -------
    >>> a = np.array([1.0, 2.0, np.nan, 4.0])
    >>> b = np.array([0.999, 2.001, np.nan, 4.0])

    >>> similar = arrays_are_similar(a, b)
    >>> print(similar)  # Expected output: True, since the non-NaN elements are close and NaN positions match.

    The function assumes that both input arrays are indeed numpy arrays and does not perform type checking. Ensure that the inputs are of the correct type to avoid unexpected behavior.
